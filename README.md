Cronch-game
===========

Idea:
-----

A 2d game based on Cr√∂nch Fight for Gewyrz.
Two character try to shoot each other from opposite sides of the screen while dodging enemy bullets or taking cover behind moving platforms in the middle of the battlefield. Players also fight over power-ups, such as vampiric bullets, speed boost, bonus hp, temporary freezing / disarming the enemy, etc. There will be a few characters, each with different strengths, weaknesess and spells (special shots, teleport, combos) and unique playstyle.

The game will support a single-player mode with enemy AI behaving differently for each of the characters. There will also be a multyplayer mode on one machine (and maybe over the internet)
The game will use simple gui.

- For the second milestone:
 - The basics of the game - field, bullets, platforms
 - At least one finished character
 - The basics of an AI capable of controling the enemy in a way that is hard to predict by the player.
 - Everything needed to make a sample run of the game.
